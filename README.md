I'm excited to share my first MeriSKILL internship project "SALES DASHBOARD" .

 Title: SALES DASHBOARD REPORT/ DASHBOARD

The objective of this project is to analyze sales data to identify trends, top-selling products, and revenue metrics for business decision-making.

In this dynamic dashboard there are kpis ðŸ“ˆ present like -
âœ… Revenue,
âœ… Sales QTY,
âœ… Profit Margin
Also analyzed-

âœ… Top 5 Best Selling Products
âœ… Weekly Sales Distribution
âœ… Top 5 cities by Sales Count
âœ… Sales by Month
âœ… Top 5 Products by Sales Count

âœ… DATA IMPORT: 
First I Gathered data from Meriskill and imported it on Power BI for data transformation
âœ… DATA TRANSFORMATION: 
Used Power Query to clean the data, removed nulls and duplicates, and fine-tuned data types. 
âœ… DATA LOADING AND MODELLING: 
Imported the transformed data into Power View for analysis. After completing the necessary cleaning, and transformation, I create the necessary relationships between the tables. (I created a calendar table separately for my convenience and connected the two tables based on a column key)
âœ… DATA IMPLEMENTATION: 
I used different DAX functions to create calculated measures and columns, refining the data for deeper insights.
